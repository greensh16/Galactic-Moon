# This code uses the users current time/latitude/longitude and calculates the moons altitude and 
# azimuth (moon.py). These 2 values are then used to plot the position of the moon on a Galactic Unicorn using
# the inbuilt Raspberry Pi Pico W.

# The graphics part of this code was built for Pimoroni's pirate-brand MicroPython.

# The ntptime library is used to set the Pico at the correct time. For this to work we need to connect to the internet
# You need to create a secrets.py script and place your SSID and its password in there. I've aslo added my 
# latitude and longitude in there too.
